<p><code>HPSearch</code> is flexible experiment tracking framework that that provides features such as a simple and powerful query mechanism for studying and visualizing the performance of past experiments meeting given criteria, the possibility to resume a previous experiment with or without modifying the original hyper-parameters (e.g., extending the number of epochs of a promising past experiment, or gradually changing the hyper-parameters to obtain an approximate curriculum learning type of approach, etc.), the capability of visualizing the learning evolution of multiple experiments based on different metrics, and many other features.</p>
<p>Recently, many different experiment tracking frameworks have been created, such as <code>mlflow</code>, <code>weight and biases</code>, <code>tensorboard</code>, <code>neptune</code>, and many others. While few of these frameworks are open-source, e.g., <code>mlflow</code> and <code>tensorboard</code>,  they usually have limited or non-existent query capabilities, and do not allow to easily resume previous experiments. <code>HPSearch</code> is an open-source framework that targets all of these requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Key-features">Key features<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-features"> </a></h2><p><code>HPSearch</code> provides, among others, the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query the performance of past experiments meeting desired criteria. This can be done either from command line with a simple command, or programmatically. Queried experiments are shown as a table sorted by performance, and visualized in graphical form, comparing the evolution of the metrics of the selected experiments during training.</li>
<li>Visualize the evolution of current experiments and compare them against previous ones using multiple metrics</li>
<li>Resume previous experiments with or without modifying their original hyper-parameters. This can be applied, for instance, when we start by performing a quick exploration of hyper-parameters by allocating a small time budget for each experiment. Once this is done, we may want to increase the exploration of  a subset of experiments that were promising, e.g., by extending their number of epochs, or using curriculum learning to gradually changing their hyper-parameters across epochs. We may also want to change only to explore hyper-parameters affecting the final part of a pipeline, where the first steps are dedicated to pre-processing and normalization techniques that might be computationally expensive and which we want to reuse. With <code>HPSearch</code>, it is easy to do that, and annotate the fact that this was done when characterizing the new experiments.</li>
<li>Good support for default values. When introducing a new hyper-parameter, all previous experiments are automatically assigned a default value for such parameter. This makes it easy to avoid repeating previous experiments in the case when the default value is one of the possible values to be explored.</li>
<li>High level of decoupling between the experiment tracking code and the model code.</li>
</ul>
